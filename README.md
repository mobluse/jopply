# jopply
Jopply (Job Apply) helps applying for jobs. This is a very early release and everything will change.

Example:  
jopply --keyword="cad" --lan=1 # Looks for job ads in Stockholm that contains CAD that can be applied for using e-mail.  
jopply --keyword="cad" --lan=1 --noemail # Looks for jobs in Stockholm that contains CAD, but not restricted 
to application via e-mail.
